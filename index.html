        <h2>A Letter From Our Chapter President, Lily Anderson:</h2>
        <p>On behalf of Gamma Omega Chapter, I would like to welcome you to Kappa Kappa Gamma at Denison University! I am immensely proud to lead this group of intelligent, kind, and empowered women. Our values of Love, Labor, Learning, and Loyalty bond us together and are the core of our sisterhood. Together, we strive to uphold these in every aspect of our lives and goals. Individually, each member brings their own talents, personalities, opinions, and backgrounds to our sisterhood. This is what makes us special and successful as a chapter, and what makes our relationships with our sisters so valuable to us.
        It is a standard of Kappa Kappa Gamma to excel academically, and together we push each other to maintain high academic goals. The women of Kappa Kappa Gamma are pursuing a multitude of majors across all colleges at Denison University. It is also important to us to support each other in reaching our greatest potential regarding character, career, and relationships. Kappa Kappa Gamma is not only a great foundation for our members, but a constant source of support throughout the challenges and successes of college. </p>
        <p>We love spending time in our home, fondly referred to as the Big White House, which is located close to campus in the Granville neighborhood. The Big White House houses 43 members, but is truly a home to all in our chapter. Members who both live in and out of the house enjoy focusing in our 24-hour quiet study rooms, eating Chef Tina's delicious food, chatting around the dining room table at all hours of the day and night, and hanging out in the TV room. Our home is a special place for members to study, share a laugh and a meal with sisters, or simply unwind from a busy day.</p>
        <p>If you are reading this now, questioning whether or not Greek Life is for you, I highly encourage you to take the chance. Greek Life provides academic support, leadership and volunteer opportunities, as well as social events such as sisterhoods and exchanges with sororities and fraternities, and events surrounding Homecoming and Machy Days. Most of all, Kappa Kappa Gamma  provides a place of comfort and support on campus, and the members of Kappa Kappa Gamma hope that you find that home away from home with us.</p>

        <p>It is difficult to put into words the effect that being a part of an organization such as Kappa Kappa Gamma can have, not only on your experience in college, but on personal growth and confidence beyond your time at Denison University. In Kappa Kappa Gamma I found a place to grow and be inspired to reach my full potential within a place of friendship and care. Personally, I am thankful for the encouragement and support of the women of Gamma Omega Chapter that allowed me to grow in confidence and develop my own voice. I would not be the same person I am today without Kappa Kappa Gamma and all of the driven, sisters I am lucky enough to surround myself with. Kappa Kappa Gamma  is the perfect addition to your college experience for these reasons, and many you may have yet to discover.</p>
        <p>What I have described only scratches the surface of Kappa Kappa Gamma. Please enjoy our website and social media to learn more about our members and what we are involved in. If you would like to know more about our Sorority on a deeper level, feel free to visit our International website at  If you have any questions about Kappa Kappa Gamma, please do not hesitate to reach out.</p>
        <p class="m-1">Sincerely,</p>
